How to get an account and a CPU quota on Stallo
===============================================

To be able to work on Stallo you must have an account and you must have
been granted CPU time on the system. There are two ways to achieve this:

Research Council Quota
----------------------

National users (including users from UiT) may apply for an account and
a CPU quota from the Research Councils share of Stallo. If you want to
apply for such a quota please use this `National quota form
<https://www.metacenter.no/mas/application/project/>`_.

UiT Quota
---------

“Local users” (i.e. users from UiT and users affiliated with UiT in some way) can apply for an account and
a quota from UiT’s share of Stallo. If you want to apply for such a quota follow the instructions here:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   uitquota.rst

Please note that most users who are allowed to apply for a UiT quota
also are allowed to apply for a quota from the Research Council –
at the same time!
