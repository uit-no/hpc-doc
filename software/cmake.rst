CMake
=====

CMake, cross-platform, open-source build system.

CMake is a family of tools designed to build, test and package
software. CMake is used to control the software compilation process
using simple platform and compiler independent configuration
files. CMake generates native makefiles and workspaces that can be
used in the compiler environment of your choice.
