General Information
===================

Description
-----------

The DFT code ADF is used in many areas of chemistry and materials science, and consists of the following parts:

* The pure DFT code based on Slater type orbitals; ADF.
* The periodic DFT code BAND shares a lot of functionality with ADF.d for treating large periodic molecular systems.
* DFTB and MOPAC are fast approximate methods to study large molecules and big periodic systems, employing DFT-based and semi-empirical data, respectively.
* Reaction dynamics in large complex systems can be studied with bond order based ReaxFF.
* COSMO-RS uses quantum mechanical data from ADF to predict thermodynamic properties of solutions and mixtures (LogP, VLE, pKa, …)

The support people in NOTUR, do not provide trouble shooting guides anymore, due to a national agreement that it is better for the community as a whole to add to the community info/knowledge pool where such is made available. For ADF/BAND we advise to search in general documentation, sending emails to support (either metacenter or scm) or trying the ADF mailing list (see https://www.scm.com/Support for more info).
